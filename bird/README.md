# Overview

This image is based on the master branch of [BIRD](https://github.com/BIRD/bird/), that is currently including the [Matt Griswold](https://github.com/grizz)'s [Large BGP communities patch](https://20c.com/~grizz/bird/add_bgp_large_communities.patch). It `EXPOSE`s port 179 and mounts host's directory `./bird` in the container's `/etc/bird` directory; here the `bird.conf` is used to give `bird` the startup configuration and `log` is used by the daemon to write its log.

It has been created to run a playground to tests Large BGP Communities: https://github.com/pierky/large-bgp-communities-playground

# Disclaimer

This image has been created with the only purpose of being used in a "playground", for labs and interoperability tests. It does not implement any security best practice. Use it at your own risk.

# How to use this image

Put the [BIRD startup config](http://bird.network.cz/?get_doc&f=bird.html) into `bird/bird.conf`...

```
# mkdir bird
# vim bird/bird.conf
```

... then run the image in detached mode (`-d`) with the local `bird` directory mounted in `/etc/bird`:

```
# docker run -d -v `pwd`/bird:/etc/bird:rw pierky/bird
```

You can verify that `log` gets populated: `cat bird/log`.

Run `docker ps` to get the running container's ID (`153b6165385f` in the example below), then use it to run BIRD's client:

```
# docker exec -it 153b6165385f birdcl
